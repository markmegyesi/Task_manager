Certainly! Here's a junior-level Python project idea that involves using SQL:

**Project Idea: Task Manager**

**Project Description:**
Create a simple command-line task manager using Python and SQL. This project will allow users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. It's a great way to learn about basic database operations with SQL and user interaction with Python.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **Task List Management:**
   - Users should be able to add new tasks with a title and description.
   - List all tasks in the database.
   - View a specific task's details.

2. **Task Modification:**
   - Update a task's title or description.
   - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
   - Delete tasks.

3. **Search and Filter:**
   - Search for tasks based on keywords.
   - Filter tasks based on completion status.

4. **Database Integration:**
   - Use SQL (SQLite or another database system of your choice) to store task data. Create a table to manage tasks.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Create a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the task manager.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to manage cases such as task not found, invalid input, etc.

7. **Data Validation:**
   - Validate user inputs to ensure data integrity.

This project will teach you how to work with databases using SQL and integrate them into your Python application. It's a great way to learn about database CRUD operations and how to build a user-friendly interface. You can start with SQLite for simplicity and later transition to other SQL databases if you wish.

Remember to break down the project into manageable tasks, use proper documentation, and consider best practices for both Python and SQL. This project can be expanded with additional features and improvements as you gain more experience.
